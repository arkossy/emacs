Commentary:

This file is the personal settings initialisation file for Emacs. 
The reason I created this file is that I wanted to separate the 
compulsory boot code from the custom settings and personal settings.
My emacs code structure has been influenced by learning from
Protesilaos Stavrou <info@protesilaos.com>.
