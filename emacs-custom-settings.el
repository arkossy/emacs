;;; Commentary:

;; This file is the custom initialisation file for Emacs. The reason I
;; created this file is that I wanted to separate the compulsory boot
;; code from the custom settings and personal settings.
;; My emacs code structure has been influenced by learning from
;; Protesilaos Stavrou <info@protesilaos.com>.

;; See my dotfiles: https://https://github.com/arkossy

;;; Code:


(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
